        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <br>
            <li>4 tablespoons finely crushed crunchy Cheetos, divided</li>
            <br>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Remove from heat and spray with cooking spray. Place over medium heat; spoon 1 tablespoon crushed Cheetos into an area approximately the same size as a cheese slice.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Place one cheese slice on top of crushed Cheetos, and cook until cheese is melted and lightly browned around the edges, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Place a pickle spear in the middle of the cheese slice, then gently fold the edges of the cheese around the pickle.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Remove from the skillet and place on a wire rack or paper towel-lined plate.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Repeat with remaining crushed Cheetos, cheese slices, and pickle spears, wiping out the skillet and spraying with cooking spray between batches.</li>
        </ol>
