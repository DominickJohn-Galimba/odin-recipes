        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>A Reuben is a grilled sandwich featuring corned beef on rye bread. The Reuben</p>
        <p>is a menu staple in Jewish-style delicatessens, but it's not technically kosher</p>
        <p>because it combines meat and cheese.</p>
        <h2>What is on Reuben?</h2>
        <p>A traditional reuben sandwich consists of thinly slice corned beef,swiss</p>
        <p>cheese, and sauerkraut on rye bread slathered with Russian or Thousand Island</p>
        <p>dressing.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 slices rye bread</li>
            <br>
            <li>Â½ cup Thousand Island dressing</li>
            <br>
            <li>8 slices Swiss cheese</li>
            <br>
            <li>8 slices deli sliced corned beef</li>
            <br>
            <li>1 cup sauerkraut, drained</li>
            <br>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a large griddle or skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Spread one side of bread slices evenly with Thousand Island dressing. On four bread slices, layer one slice Swiss cheese, 2 slices corned beef, 1/4 cup sauerkraut, and a second slice of Swiss cheese. Top with remaining bread slices, dressing-side down. Butter the top of each sandwich.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Place sandwiches, butter-side down on the preheated griddle; butter the top of each sandwich with remaining butter. Grill until both sides are golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Serve hot.</li>
